# Javascript Objects

In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages, and act as handy data containers. The object-based nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language.
