# Challenge
Using the JavaScript language, have the function NearestSmallValues(arr) take the array of integers stored in arr, and for each element in the list, search all the previous values for the nearest element that is smaller than the current element and create a new list from these numbers...

### Sample Test Cases
```
    Input:5, 3, 1, 9, 7, 3, 4, 1

    Output:"-1 -1 -1 1 1 1 3 1"


    Input:2, 4, 5, 1, 7

    Output:"-1 2 4 -1 1"
```

>Note: If there is no previous value which smaller then push -1 to the new array.
