Interviewer: What is the time complexity of this function

You: O(n2)

Interviewer: Can you make this better

You: Let me see. I can have an object where i will store the difference of sum and element. And then when i get to a new element and if i find the difference is the object, then i have a pair that sums up to the desired sum.(try2)
