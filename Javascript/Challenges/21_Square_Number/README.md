Find a square of a number. but you can only use addition or subtraction but no multiplication or division

This is easy if you think about it the right way. Gaussâ€™ formula for the sum of the first n integers is = n(n+1)/2. By distributing the multiplication through the addition and rearranging terms, this becomes n^2 = ( 2 * sum of n integers) - n. So add up the integers to n, add the sum to itself, and subtract n:
