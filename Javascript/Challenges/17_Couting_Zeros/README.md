Question: Count Total number of zeros from 1 upto n?

Answer: If n = 100. number of 0 would be 11 (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100). Please note that 100 has two 0. This one looks simple but little tricky

Explanation: So the trick here is. if you have a number 1 to 50 the value is 5. just 50 divided by 10. However, if the value is 100. the value is 11. you will get by 100/10 = 10 and 10/10 = 1. Thats how you will get in the more zeros in one number like (100, 200, 1000)
