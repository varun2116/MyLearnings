# Searching Algorithms

Searching for data is a fundamental computer programming task that has been studied for many years.

There are two ways to search for data in a list:
  1. Sequential Search and
  2. Binary search  
A sequential search is used when the items in a list are in random order; a binary search is used when the items in a list are in sorted order. Binary search is the more efficient algorithm, but you also have to take into account the extra time it takes to sort the data set before being able to search it for a value.
