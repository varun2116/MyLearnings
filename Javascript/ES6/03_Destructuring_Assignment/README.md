# Destructuring Assignment

The destructuring assignment is an expression that allows you to assign the values or properties of an iterable or object, to the variables, using a syntax that looks similar to the array or object construction literals respectively.

A destructuring assignment makes it easy to extract data from iterables or objects by providing a shorter syntax.

There are two kinds of destructuring assignment expressionsâ€”the array and object destructuring assignment.

1. [The Array Destructuring Assignment](01_Array)
2. [The Object Destructuring Assignment](02_Object)
