## Creational Design Patterns

These kind of patterns focus on ways to create objects. When creating objects in large applications, the tendency to make things complex is always there. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation.

1. Creational Patterns

    1. Abstract Factory:  Creates an instance of several families of classes. Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

    2. Builder: Separates object construction from its representation. Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations.

    3. Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes. Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

    4. Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned. Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

    5. Singleton: A class of which only a single instance can exist. Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
