# Standard built-in objects

The term "global objects" (or standard built-in objects) here is not to be confused with the **global object**. Here, global objects refer to **objects in the global scope**. The **global object** itself can be accessed using the `this` operator in the global scope (but only if ECMAScript 5 strict mode is not used; in that case it returns `undefined`). In fact, the global scope consists of the properties of the global object, including inherited properties, if any.
