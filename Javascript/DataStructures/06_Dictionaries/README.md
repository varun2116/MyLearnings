# Dictionaries

A dictionary is a data structure that stores data as *key-value* pairs, such as the way a phone book stores its data as names and phone numbers. When you look for a phone number, you first search for the name, and when you find the name, the phone number is found right next to the name. The *key* is the element you use to perform a search, and the *value* is the result of the search.

The *JavaScript Object class* is designed to operate as a dictionary. In this chapter we’ll use the features of the Object class to build a *Dictionary class* that simplifies working with a dictionary-type object. You can perform the same functions shown in this chapter using just JavaScript arrays and objects, but creating a Dictionary class makes doing the work easier and more fun. For example, it’s a lot easier to use *()* to reference keys rather than having to use *[]* notation. There is also, of course, the advantage of being able to define functions for performing collective operations, such as displaying all entries in a dictionary, rather than having to write loops in the main program to perform the same operations.
