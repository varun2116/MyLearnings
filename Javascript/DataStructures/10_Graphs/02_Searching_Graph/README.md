## Searching a Graph

Determining which vertices can be reached from a specified vertex is a common activity performed on graphs. We might want to know which roads lead from one town to other towns on the map, or which flights can take us from one airport to other airports.

These operations are performed on a graph using a search algorithm.

There are two fundamental searches we can perform on a graph: the **depth-first** search and the **breadth-first** search.

* [DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH](01_DEPTH-FIRST_SEARCH)
* [BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH](02_BREADTH-FIRST_SEARCH)
